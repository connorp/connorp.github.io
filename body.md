Connor is a PhD student in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu). As an environmental and public economist, their research explores how policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils can accommodate emissions variation and distributional and equity concerns, and how flood insurance markets and policy design influence homeowner decisionmaking in flood zones. Connor's work spans the fields of natural resources, environmental, public, and urban economics, and combines computational tools from the natural sciences with economic models of optimal policy design.

Prior to studying at Berkeley, Connor worked as a research assistant at [the RAND Corporation](https://rand.org), researching facility resilience, Army readiness, and personnel and resource employment. They have a masters degree in Agricultural and Resource Economics from UC Davis, and a bachelors degree in Physics from UC Berkeley.

### _In Progress:_ Flood Insurance and Home Sales {.article}

Welfare improving buyouts of high flood risk homes need to be carefully designed to overcome political opposition, and identifying homeowners most likely to sell their homes in the wake of a flood could allow FEMA or local agencies to target buyouts in the wake of a disaster. I assemble a panel of real estate and flood insurance policy data to estimate whether holding an insurance policy impacts homeowners' likelihood of selling their home following a flood.

### _In Progress:_ Optimal and Second Best Nitrogen Emissions Mitigation Policy {.article}

_With Jim Sallee:_ Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, produced primarily by global agricultural activities. However, emissions levels are thought to be highly heterogeneous across producers and regions, and are challenging to measure directly. Thus, designing policies to reduce nitrous oxide emissions has proven more difficult than policies that address carbon dioxide or methane emissions. We are analyzing the efficacy, efficiency, and equity of plausible regulatory policies that seek to reduce nitrogen emissions from agricultural soils, taking into account the causes and magnitudes of heterogeneity of emissions across emitters. We are applying tools of public finance to evaluate various real world emissions reduction policies, comparing the welfare impact of an imperfectly targeted tax or policy to the optimal outcome when emissions vary widely across fields and crops, as well as the feasibility of compensating farmers who might stand to be made worse off by a policy while improving welfare overall. These economic tools allow us to quantify the heterogeneity we observe in nitrogen emissions, as well as choose the best policies in light of it.
